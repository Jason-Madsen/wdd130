                <h3>Client Report</h3>
                <p>I wanted to make my website about the Future of A.I. because of how influential and important it will become for future jobs and understanding it is essential. I wanted to give my site a technology theme with light blues and whites as the design. I used google and AI to help me find pictures that I could use for my design. I was able to communicate with my developer through MS Teams, however only after I spoke to him in class and told him that I had messaged him. The only issue with communication is he thought he had lost my site plan, but it was only misplaced and this delayed progress on the site. He has not given me many updates, as of right now, the site has minimal design of the site plan that I gave, there are no links ot the subpages that I can find nor are any of the images found on the page other than the logo. I imagine he is still working on it and trying to help his junior developers finish on time as well. In the future, I think I would talk to my team that I hire and set the expectations, ask them for updates and information on what they are doing each week so that I can make or implement any changes needed before the entirety of the design is done.</p>

                <h3>Lead Developer Report</h3>
                <p>My experience as a Lead Developer for a website project was phenomenal. I loved being able to get all the work done and portion things off to my junior developers. I had slight issues with content for the site from the client in the beginning, unfortunately he didn't give us a whole lot to run with on the subpages, but we did the best we could with what we had. We used MS Teams to communicate and ensured to update the HTML and CSS after each change so that we could see what changes we needed to make and if there were any big changes we needed to adapt to. Publishing the site was a great learning experience for me for the future, as well as I quickly and efficiently got the link to him so that he could view it at any time. I reached out to him to ask if he wanted anything changed throughout the weeks to know if there were any changes we needed to make. I enjoyed using GitHub and the free resources it has, at first I felt lacking in understanding, however as I continued to learn and experiment I feel I understand now. </p>

                <h3>Junior Developer Report</h3>
                <p>As a Junior Developer I struggled a little bit more due to lack of information from my lead developer. I sought to communicate with them through MS Teams or email, but I didn't get much response until later the next week. One of my lead developers has yet to communicate with me about our project and unfortunately I have been unable to do any work on it. On the site Tales of the Ages, I was able to gain the information about what I was to do and how I was to implement it. I created the page on the story of Mulan. Communication with my lead developer for this project was seamless at this point and I was able to complete all required of me and ask what else I could do to improve. For my second project as a junior developer, as mentioned previously, no work has been accomplished by the lead developer and he has not communicated with me at all thus far. I wasn't sure how to clone the repositories and make my edits to the pages at first, but after receiving help I was able to integrate my changes smoothly and efficiently.</p>

                <h3>General Experience and Reflections</h3>
                <p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this project and what we have been able to accomplish. While there have been difficulties, I am grateful for the experience I have gained. One of the most challenging aspects was to communicate and work with others who either had not prepared or were very slow to communicate to me what we needed to do. I love to work as a team, however it felt that some members of the different teams did not want to work in the same way that I had hoped. I really loved the work of taking an idea, an outline, and turning it into something real. This made me realize that I could create many different ideas and websites for my own needs and purposes. I think that if I were to do this project again, I would seek to communicate better and understand what my teams expectations are, as well as communicate what my expectations are for them. I feel confident in that I can accomplish the work that is required of me, while I cannot force others to do the work needed from them, I can do my best with what I am given and seek to help them or push them in the right direction so they can do the same.</p>
